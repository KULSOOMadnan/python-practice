# 🚀 **Python Homework Projects - Practice & Solutions**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This repository contains my solutions to the Python homework projects from the [Panaverse Modern AI Python](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-modern-ai-python/tree/main/PROJECTS/homework_projects) repository. I am practicing these exercises to **strengthen my Python programming skills** and improve my **problem-solving abilities**.  

## 📂 **Project Structure**  
The repository consists of multiple folders (`0` to `7`), each containing several Python programs. These projects cover fundamental to advanced Python concepts, including:  

- 🟢 **Variables & Data Types**  
- 🔄 **Conditional Statements & Loops**  
- 🏗️ **Functions & Modules**  
- 🎭 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- 📂 **File Handling**  
- 📊 **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- ⚠️ **Exception Handling**  

## 🎯 **Why Am I Doing This?**  
✅ To **enhance my Python skills** through hands-on problem-solving.  
✅ To build a **strong foundation** in programming concepts.  
✅ To improve my **logical thinking and coding efficiency**.  
✅ To prepare for **real-world projects** and future development work.
